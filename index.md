### Machine Learning

[Explaining customers' supermarket choice with Random Forest Classifier](https://medium.com/@kasicakasicaa/explaining-customers-supermarket-choice-with-random-forest-classifier-41779decc2b3) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px">This paper attempts to explain the change of customer's offline behaviour based on particular example of Tesco store in Warsaw, Stalowa street. In particular, I will check how the supermarkets portfolio changed after Tesco closure for each customer. Actually there are a few possible outcomes: some users might continue doing the shopping in the supermarket chains they are used to, others might look for a replacement. In the analysis I will try to reveal behavioural patterns responsible for choosing store brands. I will use random forest classifier to predict the replacement brand for each customer, then the used features will be analysed.</p><br>
