## Visualisation

### [Member Performance vs Benchmark](/sample_page)
<p style="font-size:12px">By leveraging the power of Tableau's LOD (Level of Detail) functions, I created a dynamic and powerful visualisation by allowing users to analyse and compare data subsets within the context of the entire dataset. This comparison would not have been possible using a SQL query alone, as the WHERE clause restricts the ability to preview both the subset and the complete dataset simultaneously. This enhanced functionality enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with a comprehensive understanding of the relationships and patterns within the data.</p>

### Saneky Flow Chart
<p style="font-size:12px">By utilizing Tableau's features and functionality, I was able to present complex marketing data in a visually appealing and easily understandable format. I developed an interactive Sankey diagram that effectively showcased the flow of users across different stages of the campaign. The three levels of the Sankey chart provided a clear and intuitive visualization of the user journey, highlighting the transitions and interactions between various touchpoints.</p>
