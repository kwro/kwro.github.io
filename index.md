### Machine Learning

[Explaining customers' supermarket choice with Random Forest Classifier](https://medium.com/@kasicakasicaa/explaining-customers-supermarket-choice-with-random-forest-classifier-41779decc2b3) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px">This paper attempts to explain the change of customer's offline behaviour based on particular example of Tesco store in Warsaw, Stalowa street. In particular, I will check how the supermarkets portfolio changed after Tesco closure for each customer. Actually there are a few possible outcomes: some users might continue doing the shopping in the supermarket chains they are used to, others might look for a replacement. In the analysis I will try to reveal behavioural patterns responsible for choosing store brands. I will use random forest classifier to predict the replacement brand for each customer, then the used features will be analysed.</p>

[Classification Task on Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/kwro/Classification-on-Titanic-dataset/blob/master/Titanic%20Classification.ipynb) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px">Based on Titanic dataset the binary classification was conducted. Before training the algorithm, data cleaning and imputing missing data was performed. Next, five classification algorithms were trained. The one with the best score was then used for prediction on out-of-sample data. The final accuracy equals 0.71.</p>

[Predicting House Prices on Kaggle Data](https://github.com/kwro/Kaggle_Home_Prices_Competition) <br>
<p style="font-size:12px">The goal is to predict sale price of house based on Kaggle data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview/. The focus was placed on feature selection. When training the model, features with low variance were excluded. Finally, mean absolute error of Linear Regression model amounts to $17.7k. </p>
