## Project Motivation

Support a family-run business by increasing its Instagram visibility through an automated brand awareness campaign using open-source interaction tools.

## Overview

This project aimed to promote organic engagement and visibility for a small business on Instagram. By leveraging [an open-source engagement bot](https://github.com/GramAddict), I created a fully automated infrastructure to interact with targeted users, simulating natural content engagement with minimal ongoing input.

## My Contributions:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Setup:</strong> Deployed a lightweight Ubuntu virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to serve as the host environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Created a Dockerized Android environment to run the Instagram interaction tool reliably and reproducibly.</li>
  <li><strong>Bot Deployment & Configuration:</strong> Integrated and configured an open-source Instagram interaction script within the container, managing user authentication, targeting logic, and content parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Proxy Integration:</strong> Implemented a proxy setup to avoid platform restrictions, enhancing reliability.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Utilized <code>cron</code> jobs for scheduled execution and health monitoring of the process.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Connected the system to Telegram to receive real-time updates on process status, errors, and engagement metrics.</li>
</ul>

## Impact:
<ul>
  <li>Generated aound 4.5k views and 200 followers monthly.</li>
  <li>Drove increased visibility for the business account through daily automated outreach.</li>
  <li>Created a reusable automation framework for future social media or engagement campaigns.</li>
</ul>
